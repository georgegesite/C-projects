/*
Tree terms –
Root – Root is a special node in a tree. The entire tree is referenced through it. It does not have a parent.
Parent Node – Parent node is an immediate predecessor of a node.
Child Node – All immediate successors of a node are its children.
Siblings – Nodes with the same parent are called Siblings.
Leaf – Last node in the tree. There is no node after this node.
Edge – Edge is a connection between one node to another. It is a line between two nodes or a node and a leaf.
Path – Path is a number of successive edges from source node to destination node.

Tree terms / properties –
Tree can be termed as a RECURSIVE data structure.
In a valid tree for N Nodes we have N-1 Edges/Links
Depth of Node – Depth of a node represents the number of edges from the tree’s root node to the node.
Height of Node – Height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node & a leaf.
Height of Tree – Height of tree represents the height of its root node.

Types of Trees –
General Tree
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
AVL Tree
Spanning Tree
B-Tree
B+ Tree
Heap

Applications of Tree Data Structure –
Store hierarchical data, like folder structure, organization structure data.
Binary Search Tree is a tree that allows fast search, insert, delete on a sorted data.
Heap is a tree data structure which is implemented using arrays and used to implement priority queues.
B-Tree and B+ Tree are used to implement indexing in databases.
Used to store router-tables in routers.
Used by compilers to build syntax trees.
Used to implement expression parsers and expression solvers.*/
